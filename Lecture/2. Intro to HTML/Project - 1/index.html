				A step-by-step walk through of your first HTML pafge

			<p>
				HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language Basically, it's the "code" behind every webpage - evenm this one. If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task HTML, without styling can't do anything more than settting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames - but it is handy as it helps you structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML
			</p>
			<img src="img/coding.jpeg">
			<p>
				However simple this might seems, it is mighty useful tool when it comes to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML coding from your work process - but if you want to be an full control of your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks that'll help you get up and running. Reading this, you'll be able to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!
			</p>
			<h2>
				Step One - TAGS
			</h2>
			<img src="img/symbol image.png">
			<p>
				Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code. A tag can isdeally be seems as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's look at two types of tags:
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							&lt;tag-exaple-1&gt; I need a closing tag< tag-example-1 >	
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&lt;tag-exaple-2&gt; I don't need a cloding tag.
						<p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag. Everything is between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very commonly used exmaples of such tags are ""&lt;html&gt;,&lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;,etc
			</p>
			<p>
				The second exmaple tags about loner tags - as in, they doin't need a closing tag to function. Although it's not required, these type of taghs are often written as < tag > to make the debugging of code easier.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Step Two - HTML, HEAD, and BODY: The three pillars of your documents
			</h2>
			<img src="img/head and body.jpg">
			<p>
				These tags are essential for any HTML document. They parcel out the significant parts of your HTML code
			</p>
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>	
					&lt;BODY&gt; &lt;BODY&gt; is placed below your &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under this tag. Text, images, links and pretty much anything you can see in your browser live inside this tag.
				</li>
				<li>
					&lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HTML&gt; wraps your entire code. Everything else inyour HTML documents needs to come inside these tags
				</li>
				<li>
					&lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt; includes things like title, styles and scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!), just insude the < HTML > tag
				sss</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Step Three - A few tags that'll make your page pretty
			</h2>

			<p>
				Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let's proceed with the things that will go inside your < BODY > tag and do some magic!
			</p>
			<p>Some baisc text Formating tags:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					&lt;b&gt; &lt;b&gt;  makes your text look <b>bold</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					&lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt; makes your write in <i>cursive</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					&lt;u&gt; &lt;u&gt; <u>underlines</u> what just wrote
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example, this pience of code</p>
			<hr >
			<p>
				&lt;html&gt; <br/><br/>
				&emsp;&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;<br/><br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;body&gt;<br/><br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;i&gt; I am Istalics! &lt;i&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;b&gt; I am bold! &lt;b&gt; <br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;u&gt; And me, well, I'm underlined!&lt;u&gt; <br/><br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br/><br/>
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</p>
			<hr/><br/>
			<p>
				Should produce something like this on your broswer. Don't fret too much about the <hr/> It's just for breaking the line so that you cans tart from the next line. Enter key little when it comes to changing line inh your HTML documents
			</p>

			<h2>Tags to help you structure your content:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					&lt;br&gt; breaks the line, making you continue to the next line. 
				</li>
				<li>
					&lt;p&gt; stands for paragraph. It divides your content into paragraphs
				</li>
			</ul>
			<i>Note: You need top use these tags as space and keys do very little when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document.</i>
			<h3>Heading Tags:</h3>
			<p>HTML provides you with six tags, form &lt;H1&gt; &lt;/H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt; &lt;/H6&gt; to help you create different sized headers quucikly.</p>
			<img src="img/heading image.png">
			<h3>
				Inseting an Image
			</h3>
			<p>
				All that's good, but what fun without images on the webpage? Don't worry, &lt;IMG&gt; to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "source". Basically, it tells the broswer where it should look for the image. The system goes something like:
				<br/> 
				<i>
					< img src = "path_to your_image" />
				</i>
				<br/><br/>
				Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to take.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>
					Lists:
				</b><br/><br/>
				HTML has two types of lists - ordered and unorderd. Each item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The Syntax for creating a list is fairly simple.
				<br/><br/>
				Suppose you want to create a list like
				<ul type="circle">
					<li>
						Item 1
					</li>
					<li>
						Item 2
					</li>
					<li>
						Item 3
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br/><br/>
				The following code will easily do the job for you:
			</p>
			<hr/>
			&lt;ul&gt; <br/>
			&emsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 1 &lt;/li&gt;
			&emsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 2 &lt;/li&gt;
			&emsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 3 &lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt; <br/>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an ordered list, all you need to do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;ol&gt;.
				<br/><br/>
				Let's see what the following code does:
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				&lt;html&gt; <br/><br/>
				&emsp;&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;<br/><br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;ul&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am unordered List's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am unordered List's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am unordered List's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am unordered List's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/ul&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;ol&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am ordered List's item 1! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am ordered List's item 2! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am ordered List's item 3! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;li&gt; I am ordered List's item 4! &lt;/li&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/ol&gt;<br/>
				&emsp;&emsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br/><br/>
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</p>

				All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with a simple webpage consisting of images, heading, and lists. Further, there are various tags that HTML supports, and we thoroughly recommend you to check them out and play with them!
			</p>
			<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				You now know enought to skim through and understand any part of an HTML code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source code of any website (you'll find some tags you don't know, but that's how you learn!). Oh and welcome to the world of web development. WIth HTML under your belt, you next stop should be making your page look beautiful using CSS.
